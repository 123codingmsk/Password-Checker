# Password-Checker
This is a simple project to log into the website you want, basically, a login portal to check the password.
<p>I used basic express.js and node.js to develop this project.</br>I also used various npms like body-parser,and  express.</p>
<p>Inititally download all the dependencies u need to and proceed with the code.<br> Then make sure u also change your type to module in the json package.</p>
<p>Also initialize the npm at start...</p>

Refer to these to make the process go smoothly.
1. npm init --->> to install the npm needed
2. npm i express --->>to install express
3. npm i body-parser  -->>to install the body-parser (or can use the "express.urlencoded" to proceed)

I also added all the required files if u have already preinstalled everything, if not just delete those package files <br> so u can setup everything up from start.
   That's all...Do Code...Be Happyyy..   : )
